Theme is LOOP

Time loop
aerial looping
something that repeat
loop as a game mechanic (roguelike/replay)
while loop {}
the sonic looping
loop combo -> chaingrabs

ideas of infinite repetition

loop corruption

a loop that doesn't work properly somehow.
a loop that goes faster/slower.
a loop that decays every occurence in some way.

loop is something that the end == the beggining
> infinity, eternity concept
> conserving the status quo (peace keeping, superhero)
> going back to original state (phoenix, rebirth)

those who forget history are doomed to repeat it

instead of time, space can loop (non euclidian space)
situations can loop

> those who forget space are doomed to traverse it again

random ideas :

- you have to cut gifs/animation perfectly so they loop without seams
- dance battle where you have to copy your opponent moves and they add a lot of moves (simon game)
- Sisyphus Simulator that doesn't end
- disable part of the game loop.
- anti-snake : you have to eat the end of your tail to get bigger.
- Phoenix that age super fast. Every X seconds you go from baby to adult to elder then die and respawn.

## Gif Cutter

- You get flawed gifs that do not loop but could if cut properly.
- Arrange part of an animation to make it loop properly, so that last and first frame link into each others.

## Disable Loop

A game where you disable parts of the game loop to help someone traverse level

puzzle platformer ?
maybe player input aren't made manually ?
> buffer system with input reading

SIMULATION GAME where you disable systems, like resources respawn or unit creation.

- Disable input reading
- Disable certains parts of physics
  - Gravity, Friction ?
- Disable hitboxes
- Disable enemy AI
- Disable rendering (why ? -> additional challenge)

- match musical instrument with loop parts

## Ouroboros

Snake + Sokoban game where you must reach your tail.
cannot eat anything else than your tail. Every time the head move, the body grow behind it

## Phoenix

Platformer where you incarnate a phoenix that goes through 3 states of life really fast : baby, adult, elder, then death, rebirth and repeat. Each state has varied movement.

## FEATURE IDEA FOR SNEKOBAN
